# Working-With-Others - 4/17/2020

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them by providing answers to questions related to working with others of your Labs product.

In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate understanding over these topics by responding to prompts

## Instructions

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Journal Entry.**

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Journal Entry. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support from your TL if you need direction. Your work reflects your proficiency in user interface and your command of the concepts and techniques in team planning and product vision.

We have allocated time on your schedule to ensure that you get this done at the end of each sprint.

- For Full Time Students: Please submit your work on this journal entry before 11am PT every Friday.
- For Part Time Students: Please submit your work on this journal entry before the end of your B-Week Thursday class period.

### Introduction

Throughout this sprint you have been down in the trenches building features, delivering those features to real uses, gathering feedback, and using that feedback to inform on decisions about the future of your product.

This is all a part of the bigger picture as you have learned how to effectively not only deliver features as a part of a cross functional team, but you've **learned how to work together to do so.** At this point, it's fair to say that you're more than capable of performing the technical duties that the job market demands and now we want to focus and hear from you about how you've been working as **an effective member of a team.**

### Prompt 1

Describe your team's dynamics as they relate to the effectiveness in designing, building, and delivering software to real users.

##### What sorts of strengths do _you_ bring to the team as a contributor in your role? List out anything that highlights how you've helped push this project along.
* This project allowed me to see the front end and backend built from the ground up. After assisting implemenenting Apollo Server via Prismatopia, I found that most of my strengths was in the front-end so I've been focusing there mostly.
* I did question why some of the features we were trying to push couldnt be simplified.
* When we started I was pushing for us to use React Hook Forms to help with save data on submit, the biggest obsticle is that we had to use ANTD library, so it ended up being alot more difficult to get the functionality right, so we scraped the whole idea and went back to styled regular inputs. 
I assisted in building out the form layouts, getting the styling library to correctly register the inputs so it would work be funcyional with validation. And of course I assisted with testing with Jest and React Testing Library.

##### What are some of your weaknesses as a member of your team? How have you worked to overcome some of your individual weaknesses? Be specific.
* Im in the habit of waiting to be assigned what to do for me to act especially in a group setting even with the Trello board that was supposed to be of help, because every task in a card connected to each other. Of course, not entirely knowing where to start, each task I attempted to do, was connected to someone else's task that they were already working on it,so I felt confused and conflicted when I was wanted to start writing some code for a feature. I had to resort to peer programming so that I would be present at every step, and fill in the holes when someone needed me to research docs and how to get it to be functional.
* I'm also a slow coder and what takes someone a whole hour to build, it might take me 4. I tend to break things apart and put them together to understan what is happening, ESPECIALLY if I am building something ontop of what's already built. And I think it gives off the impression that I don't know what I'm doing, when in contrary I do, I just process things a bit differently than the rest, I just don't know how to communicate that to the team members. 

##### Describe a teamwork problem that you as a team have had to overcome. How did you contribute to the problem itself? How did you contribute to the solution to the problem? Be specific.
* One of our problems was getting React Hooks Form to work with ANTD so we did away with the RHF. ANTD still came with some issues of its own so we had to rely heavily on outside resources that were not on the docs. Having 3 pair of eyes to look at the same code honestly helped if either one of us missed a certain way to code it correctly. 
* There were some times I felt uselessless, (relating to the previous point), it seemed that when I would self appoint myself to coding a fix, or someone gave me a task to accomplish, I wouldnt even be given enough time to accomplish it, they would take over the file without communicating and asking me if I needed a hand, so what I was trying to code and code out loud would no longer make sense to me when I would reopen the file to continue my work. I admit I don't code as fast as everyone, but I have my flow, and the work always gets done one way or the other. It's as if they didnt give me a chance to prove myself. (This happened mostly when we weren't peer programming). At the end, I would ask them why they made the certain addition and walk me through the changes. It's hard, but we must move on. 
* Another challenge was implementing Graph QL schema to match the backend's data model. Some of our information we received from Austin, our stakeholder differed from one another from the backend, frontend and the UX design. So it was natural that when we tried to connect them to each other it wouldnt respond. The UX had extra fields in their mockup, us FrontEnd mimicking the design, but the backend having a different data model that didnt match what the UX mockup consisted of. We managed to come together with Austin and get this clarified by cutting down redundancies and unnecessary properties.

##### How is your team measuring the success of your product? How do you know you are solving user problems? How are you using these measurements to inform what to build next?
* Since this is a greenfield project, we haven't exactly measured how this app is helping solve the problem Beerthoven is having. So far with what we have built, Austin is very impressed and he's clearly seeing how he could get a precise count for data he needs for admininstrative purposes. He was able to sift certain features he feels would allow the app to truly be used to assist them with the success of the organization. 
* One feature he really wants us to focus on is validating redundancies of user inputs. As in if there's a repeat user(s) their information be stored to an already existing id that matches a stored email. 

## Submitting your work
