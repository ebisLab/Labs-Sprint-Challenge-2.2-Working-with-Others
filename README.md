## Instructions

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Journal Entry.**

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Journal Entry. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support from your TL if you need direction. Your work reflects your proficiency in user interface and your command of the concepts and techniques in team planning and product vision.

We have allocated time on your schedule to ensure that you get this done at the end of each sprint.

- For Full Time Students: Please submit your work on this journal entry before 11am PT every Friday.
- For Part Time Students: Please submit your work on this journal entry before the end of your B-Week Thursday class period.

### Introduction

Throughout this sprint you have been down in the trenches building features, delivering those features to real uses, gathering feedback, and using that feedback to inform on decisions about the future of your product.

This is all a part of the bigger picture as you have learned how to effectively not only deliver features as a part of a cross functional team, but you've **learned how to work together to do so.** At this point, it's fair to say that you're more than capable of performing the technical duties that the job market demands and now we want to focus and hear from you about how you've been working as **an effective member of a team.**

**Please respond to the following prompt to detail out the reasons your team pivoted away from the plan upon which you agreed as a team.**

### Prompt 1

Describe you team's dynamics as they relate to the effectiveness in designing, building, and delivering software to real users.

- What sorts of strengths do you bring to the team as a contributor in your role? List out anything that highlights how you've helped push this project along.
- What are some of your weaknesses as a member of your team? How have you worked to overcome some of your individual weaknesses? Be specific.
- Describe a teamwork problem that you as a team have had to overcome. How did you contribute to the problem itself? How did you contribute to the solution to the problem? Be specific.
- Describe how you and your team are learning about user problems and measuring whether or not the delivery of your project's features truly solves the problems or drives the objectives of your product? What do you do as a team with those learnings? How do you specifically contribute to the continuous conversations around "what we're going to build next?"

## Submitting your work
